For institutional use, this is a non-starter: treasury operations leak competitive intelligence, counterparty exposure becomes public, and regulatory obligations around data minimization are impossible to meet.',
          'However, a growing ecosystem of privacy-preserving layers can be composed on top of Ethereum: shielded pools, privacy L2s, zero-knowledge proofs, and trusted execution environments. The question is not whether Ethereum is private, but which privacy architecture fits your requirements and what trade-offs you are accepting.',

Most institutional solutions sit somewhere in between, using selective disclosure to reveal specific data to authorized parties like regulators.',

Permissioned DeFi pools (where participants are KYC\'d before entry) and privacy layers with attestation-gated access are the two main patterns that reconcile these requirements.',

A user or institution holds a spending key (for moving funds) and a separate viewing key (for disclosure). The viewing key can be shared with a regulator or auditor, who can then decrypt and verify specific transactions without seeing anything else in the pool.',

Account-based privacy (Aztec, FHE-based) is more familiar to Ethereum developers and supports richer programmability, but requires more careful design to prevent linkability.',
          'For institutional payments, UTXO models are simpler and better understood. For complex smart contract interactions (DeFi, derivatives), account-based privacy L2s offer more flexibility. The right choice depends on your use case rather than any absolute technical superiority.',
